---------------------------------------------------------------

FRESH-INSTALL

This includes all default configuration files. Any existing files will be overwritten!

* Login with SSH as root user. (Run "sudo su" if necessary to change to root.)

* Enter the following five commands:
cd /usr/local/sbin
wget http://2577.asnode.org:43856/supermonASL_fresh_install
chmod +x supermonASL_fresh_install
hash
supermonASL_fresh_install

* Edit the allmon.ini and global.inc files to match your system settings, name, callsign, etc.
  They are located in /var/www/html/supermon/ (or /srv/http/ on HamVOIP)

* Setup the Supermon .htpasswd file in the /var/www/html/supermon/ directory.
  You will not be able to log into Supermon until you do this. Run the following commands in
  the supermon directory:
  # Note: [username] = User name under your node stanza in allmon.ini (default is 'admin')
  # For first user:
  sudo htpasswd -c .htpasswd [username]
  # Then enter the password that the user should enter into their browser to log in
  # For any additional users:
  sudo htpasswd .htpasswd [username]

* Add the following line to your root user crontab:
0 3 * * * (/var/www/html/supermon/astdb.php cron)
  (To do this run "crontab -e" to open the cron table for editing, then paste the above line
  at the bottom, save and exit. This will update the AllStar database file once a day.)
